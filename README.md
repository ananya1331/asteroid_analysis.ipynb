# 🚀 NASA Asteroid Hazard Prediction  

This project analyzes NASA asteroid data and applies Machine Learning to predict hazardous asteroids.  

## 📊 Key Features  
- Data analysis & visualization  
- Logistic Regression model for classification  
- Insights into asteroid size, speed & risk  

## 📁 Dataset  
- Data sourced from NASA API  
- Contains 986 asteroid entries  

## 🖥️ Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)  
- Google Colab for development  
- Logistic Regression for classification  

## 🔗 Results & Insights  
- The model achieved **85% accuracy**  
- Identified asteroid risk factors based on velocity & size  

## 🚀 How to Run This Project
1.Open Google Colab: This project is designed to run easily in a Colab notebook — no setup required on your local machine.
2.Upload & Run asteroid_analysis.ipynb
-Go to Google Colab
-Upload the notebook file
-Run the cells sequentially
3.Install dependencies using:
!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
4.Optional: If using locally, clone the repo and run:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/asa-asteroid-hazard.git
cd asa-asteroid-hazard
jupyter notebook

## ✅ Output
-Visual graphs showing asteroid characteristics
-Model predictions and evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
-Final output identifying hazardous vs. non-hazardous asteroids
